# NBA-Data-Preprocessing-Hyperskill
This is "NBA Data Preprocessing" project form Hyperskill.<br>
Learn how to handle missing values in numerical and categorical variables, clean a DataFrame using element-wise operations, handle high-cardinality features, and engineer new features from the existing ones. Determine which features to keep and which ones to drop in the case of multicollinearity and get to know data transformation techniques.<br>
Data preprocessing is one of the first steps in the machine learning workflow. The main idea is to transform raw data into a format that machine learning algorithms can easily understand. The predictive performance of a machine learning model highly depends on the input data quality. Thus, it's an absolute must to know how to improve the quality of your input data by removing the features with low predictive value, engineering new ones, and dealing with multicollinearity. With this project, you'll apply these concepts to NBA data to get a high-quality dataset ready to be fed to a linear model!<br>
